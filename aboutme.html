  <h2 class="rainbow" style="text-align:center">About Me !!!</h2>
    <br></br>
    I am !! crashdotcom (or voxus_) but you can call me <b class="rainbow">crash</b> (he/they). I like coding and art and my friends .. and playing Minecraft and listening to death metal and going to punk shows >_O
    <br></br>
    <p>I'm a college student studying CS and I also do art on the side. I'm still learning and figuring things out so my website might be kinda janky but I like to think it's part of the charm ^^ in the future I want to work on accessibilty technology or computer graphics or augmented reality products (or anything else that piques my interest). I'll try to keep this page updated with artwork and coding projects and other things I make. </p>
